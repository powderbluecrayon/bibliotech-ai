>>> how to set up a user on macos for ssh?
 Setting up a user account for SSH access on a macOS system involves creating a new user, generating an SSH key pair, and setting up the necessary permissions. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the Terminal app on your Mac.

2. To create a new user, use the following command:

```bash
sudo dscl . -create /Users/<username> UserShell /bin/bash
```

Replace `<username>` with the desired username for the new account. This command creates a new user with a default shell set to bash.

3. Set a password for the new user by using the following command:

```bash
sudo passwd <username>
```

Enter and confirm the new password when prompted.

4. Generate an SSH key pair (public-private keys) for the new user with the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

5. Generate a new SSH key by using the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "<email@example.com>"
```

Replace `<email@example.com>` with the email address associated with the user. The default location for the key pair will be in the `~/.ssh/` directory.

6. Copy the public key to the remote machine using the following command:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy
```

7. Log in to the remote Mac as the administrator user and open the Terminal app. Add the copied SSH key to the new user's account by pasting it into the `authorized_keys` file:

```bash
echo "<pasted-key>" >> /Users/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 /Users/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Replace `<pasted-key>` with the copied SSH key and replace `<username>` with the username you created earlier.

8. Modify the permissions of the new user's home folder to allow for SSH access:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 755 /Users/<username>
```

9. To limit the SSH login methods, disable password authentication by editing the SSH configuration file (located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`). Add or uncomment this line:

```bash
AuthenticationMethods publickey
```

10. Save the changes and restart the SSH service with the following commands:

```bash
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.sshd.plist
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.sshd.plist
```

Now the new user can log in to the remote Mac using SSH from their local machine without entering a password, as long as they have the private key file on their local machine.
